#In this project we were given code for a Treasure Hunt game. The goal was to help the AI agent, a pirate, find the treasure. I was provided with most of the code including code for the environment, such as movement, rewards, actions, etc., and experience, such as reinforcement learning, but needed to create the code for the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, which was a pathfinding problem.

#Computer scientists are continually working either in a research capacity or application in order to improve existenting processes and create new processes to improve the lives of individuals. This is important, because this work advances society in important fields such as medicine, technology, and even transportation.

#When approaching a problem as a computer scientist it's important to gather data, gather user requirements, and to test as much as possible. A problem must be approached with an unbiased eye to best achieve an unbiased outcome.

#Ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization can be many. However, minimally it is important to let users know when any data is being collected or if an application requires any data, such as location, for an application to be used. For an organization, it's important to respect user and organizational data, especially in terms of testing. This data should not be shared, unless that's what the data's purpose is for. Essentially, privacy and data integrity are imperative.
